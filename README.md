# Garden Setup

This repository describes the Gardener product comprising of components which need to be installed for a Gardener landscape. A Gardener landscape can be installed using [_Sow_](https://github.com/gardener/sow)  based on the Gardener product definition in _garden-setup_ and a landscape configuration parametrizing the actual landscape to be installed.
